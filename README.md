# Trustworthy Enterprise Generative AI Working Group (IEEE P7022)

### Status: Proposed IEEE Standard (PAR Submitted). Pending NesCom Approval (Expected March 2026).

## Overview

IEEE P7022 ("Standard for Requirements and Evaluation Criteria for Trustworthy Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Enterprise Applications") specifies the engineering audit layer for stochastic AI systems.

While existing frameworks (ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF) define management processes, P7022 is designed to define the technical artifacts, failure taxonomies, and JSON-level evidence schemas required to demonstrate conformance in high-stakes enterprise environments (ERP, Finance, HRIS).

## Scope & Technical Objectives

This project operationalizes "Trustworthy AI" principles into verifiable engineering requirements:

<li>Taxonomy: Standardized definitions for output integrity failures (e.g., unsupported claims, source amnesia, hallucination types).

<li>Measurement: Engineering metrics for reliability, grounding-attribution accuracy, and reproducibility.

<li>Controls: Technical requirements for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), prompt-to-action traceability, and low-confidence escalation.

<li>Evidence: Specifications for audit bundles, including versioned model cards and immutable trace logs.

## Repository Contents

This repository currently hosts the public-facing recruitment and information portal for the Working Group.

index.html: The project landing page and stakeholder registration portal.

Note: As the Working Group evolves, this organization may host open-source reference implementations of evidence schemas or validation scripts, subject to IEEE SA policies.

## Participation

Participation is open to all materially interested parties (Enterprise Deployers, Assurance Providers, Vendors, Regulators) and follows the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE SA) consensus process.

To join the drafting committee or requesting an introductory discussion:

Action: Register via the Portal

Kickoff: Scheduled for April 2026 (Subject to NesCom approval).
